-- This is the code for the task done on db-fiddle. Although unecessary in real life situations, i have added som extra code not required in the task to display the changes after every step. i do understand that the confirmation that the code has ran without error is enough of a confirmation and therefore a more efficient way of coding is to rely on that confirmation, but as a way of using this task to also train my sql skill i have added those extra lines of codes to display these changes.

-- Create the Student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    STU_NUM CHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,

    STU_STARTDATE DATE,
    COURSE_CODE CHAR(3),
    PROJ_NUM INT(2)
